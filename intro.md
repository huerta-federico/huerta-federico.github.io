# Welcome to my Jupyter book

Hi, my name is Federico Huerta and this is my Jupyter book hosted publicly thanks to Github Pages. This website was made as an assignment for the subject of "Development based on web platforms" in the "Universidad TÃ©cnica Particular de Loja".

The additional pages from this book are placeholders with random text.
